# imputation_sims

Converts fsc26 output to plink files (PED and MAP) and creates .par file for Eigensoft softwares

Works for simulated DNA seqs in the form of snps (numeric strings).
Considers individuals to be diploid, so
1_1 and 1_2 individuals from .arp files are considered to belong to the same individual. The plink output will be in the form of:
1_1
1_3 
etc...

Input parameters:
- file.arp (Fsc26 arlequin output file)
- output name
- number of haploid individuals (ie. 1000 haploid individuals = 500 diploid individuals)
